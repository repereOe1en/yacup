The problem was stated as follows: for each of the tracks in test data 100 other tracks with the highest chance of being covers of the initial one should be found. In train data is divided into "cliques": sets of tracks, that are versions of each other. To be able to process all of the data at the same time in colab data should've been processed (data.py).
